NTT Docomo _i-mode_ emojis started as monochrome pixel art, but have been [available as vector graphics](https://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/service/developer/smart_phone/make_contents/pictograph/download/) as well for a while now.
Since 2012, when Android 4.4 introduced color emojis, KDDI au _EZweb_ has been using the same glyphs, whereas Softbank (with Ymobile, E-Mobile, Willcom, Disney Mobile) continues to use its own design (as do all non-Japanese vendors).
In 2014, the set was updated to cover all Unicode emojis of the time. 
As far as I know there have been no subsequent updates (neither for Unicode 8.0 and 9.0 nor the emoji sequences from UTR#51),

These shall hence form the base of a variety of fonts and picture sets.
